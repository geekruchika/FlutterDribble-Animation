# FlutterDribble-Animation


# Flutter Login Animation

A new open-source Flutter project that enables the developer to quickly get started with the Flutter animation and application development. I will be taking you through the steps to implement smooth animations in your Flutter app. Here’s a GIF that shows a Flutter app that I created. It is a rebuild version of a UI design that I came across on Dribble.

This project contains the basic features that are required to build an amazing Flutter application.
